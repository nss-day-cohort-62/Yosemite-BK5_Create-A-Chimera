# Create a Chimera

The owners of Create a Chimera have asked you to build a Web based UI that allows customers to pick which parts they want in their new and excitingly malformed animal!

## User Stories

Diners at Create A Chimera should be able to pick from a variety of body parts for the head, torso, and legs of their new creation.

There should also be a Create Chimera button, when the user clicks the button, their chimera number and price total should be printed below the button.

## Layout

At the top of the browser window, the user should see a list of choices (head, torso, legs, power), with one column for each.

Below that show the button and the previous chimeras.
